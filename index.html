                Can you imagine your life without a computer?
                <br><br>Think about all of the things you wouldn’t be able to do. Send an email or online shop, and find an answer to a question instantly. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
                <br><br>We’ve come a long way from the very first computer and even the first smartphone. But how much do you really know about their history and evolution? From floppy discs to <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI) software</a>, the Acorn to the Macintosh, let’s explore how far we’ve come.
                <br><br>While today we use computers for both work and play, they were actually created for an entirely different purpose.
                <br><br>In 1880, the population of the United States had grown so large that it took seven years to formulate the results of the U.S. Census. So, the government looked for a faster way to get the job done, which is why punch-card computers were invented, which took up an entire room. The first digital computer, known as the Pascal Machine, has its roots in the 16th century. The Pascal Machine was the first revelation in the world of computers before Charles Babbage invented the Difference engine. From assembly to binary, we have come a long way.
                <br><br>While that’s how the story starts, it’s certainly not where it ends. Let’s explore the history of computers.

                In the 1600s, the idea of an analog computer became a little known. A computer was referred to a device that is used for mathematical and statistical calculations. It used the techniques of decimal, statistics and logarithmic expressions to compute values. Women were tasked with such calculations and computations.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1617</span>: John Napier invented Napier Bones, a manual calculating apparatus. Napier bones was a handheld device that used to support multiplication and division. It was also known as Napier Rods.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1642</span>: Biase Pascal, a french mathematician invented Pascaline, which is also known as the world's first automated calculator. 
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1642</span>: Gottfried Willhelm Liebniz invented Stepped Reckoner or Liebniz wheel, which was an improved version of Pascaline. This mechanical calculator could do basic calculations and was made of flat drums.

                Also in 1939, Bell Telephone Laboratories completed The Complex Number Calculator, designed by George Stibitz.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1941</span>: Professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University J.V. Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry designed a computer that can solve 29 equations simultaneously. This is the first time a computer is able to house data within its own memory.
                <br><br> That same year, German engineer Konrad Zuse created the Z3 computer, which used 2,300 relays, performed floating-point binary arithmetic, and had a 22-bit word length. This computer was eventually destroyed in a bombing raid in Berlin in 1943.
                <br><br> Additionally, in 1941, Alan Turing and Harold Keen built the British Bombe, which decrypted Nazi ENIGMA-based military communications during World War II.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1943</span>: John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, professors at the University of Pennsylvania, built an <span class="font-bold">Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC)</span>. This is considered to be the grandfather of digital computers, as it is made up of 18,000 vacuum tubes and fills up a 20-foot by 40-foot room.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1944</span>: J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the successor of ENIAC, known as Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer which was one of the earliest electronic computer that could process and store discrete data                
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1951</span>:  The first commercially produced digital computer, known as UNIVAC, was launched as a general purpose commercial computer for the US business economy.

                Also, in 1943, the U.S. Army asked that Bell Laboratories design a machine to assist in the testing of their M-9 director, which was a type of computer that aims large guns at their targets. George Stibitz recommended a delay-based calculator for the project. This resulted in the Relay Interpolator, which was later known as the Bell Labs Model II.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1944</span>: British engineer Tommy Flowers designed the Colossus, which was created to break the complex code used by the Nazis in World War II. A total of ten were delivered, each using roughly 2,500 vacuum tubes. These machines would reduce the time it took to break their code from weeks to hours, leading historians to believe they greatly shortened the war by being able to understand the intentions and beliefs of the Nazis.
                <br><br>  That same year, Harvard physics professor Howard Aiken built and designed The Harvard Mark 1, a room-sized, relay-based calculator.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1945</span>: Mathematician John von Neumann writes The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. This paper broke down the architecture of a stored-program computer.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1946</span>: Mauchly and Eckert left the University of Pennsylvania and obtained funding from the Census Bureau to build the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC). This would become the first commercial computer for business and government use.
                <br><br>  That same year, Will F. Jenkins published the science fiction short story A Logic Named Joe, which detailed a world where computers, called Logics, interconnect into a worldwide network. When a Logic malfunctions, it gives out secret information about forbidden topics.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1947</span>: Walter Brattain, William Shockley, and John Bradeen of Bell Laboratories invented the transistor, which allowed them to discover a way to make an electric switch using solid materials, not vacuums.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1947</span>: Kathleen Booth invented assembly language that converted high level language (HLL) into machine language. It bridged software functioning with the hardware.  
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1948</span>: Frederick Williams, Geoff Toothill, and Tom Kilburn, researchers at the University of Manchester, developed the Small-Scale Experimental Machine. This was built to test new memory technology, which became the first high-speed electronic random access memory for computers. The became the first program to run on a digital, electronic, stored-program computer.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1950</span>: Built in Washington, DC, the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC) was created, becoming the first stored-program computer completed in the United States. It was a test bed for evaluating components and systems, in addition to setting computer standards.
                <br><br> <span class="font-bold">1953</span>: Computer scientist Grace Hopper develops the first computer language, which is eventually known as Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), that allowed a computer user to use English-like words instead of numbers to give the computer instructions. In 1997, a study showed that over 200 billion lines of COBOL code were still in existence.
